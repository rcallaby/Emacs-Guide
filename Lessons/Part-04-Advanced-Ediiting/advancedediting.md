## Emacs: Markers and Bookmarks

### Setting and Navigating Markers

In Emacs, markers are a powerful way to remember specific positions in a buffer. They allow you to set a point at a certain location and easily return to it later. To set a marker, you can use `C-x r m` (where `C-x r` is the prefix for registering actions) followed by a letter or a number. For example, `C-x r m a` sets a marker at the current point. To return to this marker, you can use `C-x r b a` (or `C-x r ' a` for a single quote prefix).

### Managing Bookmarks

Bookmarks in Emacs serve as a way to remember specific positions in files, much like bookmarks in a web browser. You can set a bookmark using `C-x r m` followed by `m`, and then provide a name. For instance, `C-x r m m` will prompt you for a bookmark name. To jump to a bookmark, you can use `C-x r b` followed by the bookmark name.

## Emacs: Registers and Rectangles

### Utilizing Registers for Quick Access

Registers in Emacs are a versatile tool for storing text, positions, or even macros for later use. They're like variables that can hold a wide range of information. To save something to a register, use `C-x r s` followed by a character (e.g., `a`). This saves the current region. To retrieve the content, you can use `C-x r i` followed by the register character.

### Editing Rectangular Regions

Rectangles in Emacs are a powerful way to operate on columns of text rather than entire lines. You can mark a rectangular region by using `C-x SPC` (`C-x` followed by the spacebar) and then navigating with movement keys. Once selected, you can perform various operations like cut, copy, or paste with `C-x r k` (kill rectangle) or `C-x r y` (yank rectangle).
